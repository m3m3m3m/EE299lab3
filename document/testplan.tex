We will need to test three main parts for this module. The first part is the correctness of display. The highlighted point is whether the boxes are approximately evenly distributed on the screen. The second part is the valid transmission of commands and parameters from the master board to the slave board. The highlighted point is the wireless communication and the proper setting of delay time. The wireless communication is a new thing in this lab. The basic realization is powered by XBee. We followed the instruction and set the proxies for both boards, then the two boards can communicate with an identical channel number. The third part is the control of the joystick and direction buttons. We need to test whether all the movement of the joystick can be correctly handled by the module.
